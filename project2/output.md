📘 Toast Notification 
A Toast Notification 🍞 is a brief, unobtrusive message that pops up on a user interface to inform users of a particular event or status update. It typically appears at the corner of the screen (often the top-right or bottom-right), automatically disappears after a few seconds, and does not interrupt the user’s current workflow.

⚙️ Key Characteristics of Toast Notifications
Non-blocking UI element – Allows the user to continue interaction without closing the notification ❌.

Auto-dismissable – Typically disappears after a set duration (e.g., 3–5 seconds) ⏲️.

Contextual Feedback – Used for success, error, warning, or info messages:

✅ Success: Action was completed (e.g., "Saved successfully!")

❌ Error: Something went wrong (e.g., "Failed to save!")

⚠️ Warning: Potential issue (e.g., "Unsaved changes!")

ℹ️ Info: General updates (e.g., "You are offline!")
