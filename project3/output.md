📘 Stopwatch 
A Stopwatch ⏱️ is a digital time-tracking tool that allows users to measure elapsed time from the moment it is started to the moment it is stopped. Commonly used in sports, productivity apps, and educational tools, a stopwatch helps track time with precision — often down to milliseconds.

In software development, a stopwatch component is typically implemented as part of a JavaScript, React, Flutter, or Android app, and is a great project for beginners learning about time management in programming.

⚙️ Core Features of a Stopwatch App
▶️ Start: Begins counting the time from zero.

⏸️ Pause: Temporarily stops the timer without resetting.

🔄 Reset: Clears the current time and resets to zero.

🕒 Lap/Split (optional): Captures time at a specific moment while continuing the count.

🧠 Technical Concepts Covered
Creating a stopwatch involves understanding and working with:

setInterval() and clearInterval() in JavaScript 🧩

React useState and useEffect for reactive UIs ⚛️

DateTime handling in mobile apps 📱

UI updates and DOM manipulation 🎨
