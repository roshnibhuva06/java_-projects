🦠 COVID-19 India Stats Dashboard

The COVID-19 India Stats Dashboard is a responsive web application that fetches real-time, state-wise COVID-19 statistics for India using the Rootnet COVID-19 API. The application dynamically displays the data in a well-structured, visually appealing table format, utilizing Bootstrap 5 for a clean and modern UI/UX. It provides a quick overview of key COVID-19 metrics, including the number of Indian and foreign cases, recoveries, deaths, and the total confirmed cases for each Indian state and union territory.

This project is a hands-on demonstration of integrating REST APIs, JSON parsing, DOM manipulation, and responsive design using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript.
