🛍️ Add to Cart
The "Add to Cart" or "Add to Shopping Bag" feature is a core function of any e-commerce platform 🛒. It replicates the real-world shopping experience of placing products into a physical shopping bag 👜, allowing users to collect multiple items before proceeding to checkout 💳.

This feature not only facilitates the buying process but also enhances the user's journey through convenience, flexibility, and strategic engagement tools.

🎯 Purpose and Importance:
Temporary Storage of Products 🧺
Enables users to save items they intend to purchase, offering the freedom to browse further without losing their selections.

Easy Management 📋
Customers can review, edit, adjust quantities, or remove products directly within the shopping bag, ensuring better control over their orders.

Building User Confidence 🔎
Seeing selected products grouped together boosts trust and encourages purchase completion.

Promoting Higher Sales 💰
Through upselling (📈 suggesting premium products) and cross-selling (🔗 suggesting related items), shopping bags often help increase the overall cart value.

Session Continuity 🔄
Persistent shopping bags allow users to pick up where they left off, whether across different sessions, browsers 🌐, or devices 📱.

Applying Promotions and Discounts 🎟️
Users can apply coupons, see discounts dynamically, and view offers, making their shopping experience more rewarding.

Checkout Preparation 🛠️
The bag provides a summary of costs (subtotal, taxes, shipping fees 🚚) and helps users finalize their orders with full transparency.
